    <h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
    
    <p>Time complexity is a fundamental concept in computer science that describes how the runtime of an algorithm increases with input size. A good algorithm is considered efficient when it has a lower time complexity, ensuring faster execution even with large inputs.</p>
    
    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm requires as a function of its input size. It is often expressed using Big O notation, such as O(n), to describe the worst-case memory usage.</p>
